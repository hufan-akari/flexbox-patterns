# Flexbox Patterns
This repository is forked from [cjcenizal/flexbox-patterns](https://github.com/cjcenizal/flexbox-patterns) and rewrite with jekyll.

---

> This repository contains the original CSS used for the components at [www.flexboxpatterns.com](http://www.flexboxpatterns.com). Feel free to use these styles however you like!
>
>  ## Getting started
>
>  Assuming you have Node installed, you can install the project dependencies with `npm install`. This will install PostCSS and Autoprefixer; two critical tools for making your CSS cross-browser compatible.
>
> ## Commands
>
> `npm run build`
>
> This command will concatenate the source CSS files into a single CSS file, and then use PostCSS to add various vendor-prefixed properties. Open up `dist/index.html` to see a demo page of the various flexbox patterns in the browser.
>
> ## Things to keep in mind
>
> _I don't recommend copy-pasting these examples directly into production code._ I'm only trying to demonstrate different ways of using flexbox through these examples, so they may not incorporate some accessibility best practices (such as using semantic HTML5 elements and the `role` attribute). Before using this code in production you should make sure it meets your accessibility needs.
