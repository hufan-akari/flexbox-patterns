We can use the same properties as in the Centered Prompt example to center other content, such as icons. In this example, the icon is centered inside of the circle.
```css
{% include_relative assets/styles/centered-icon.css %}
```
```html
{% include_relative assets/examples/centered-icon.html %}
```
