This would be pretty easy to do without flexbox, right? You would just set each Photo to have `display: inline-block`, and you would get the same basic layout.

But inline-block elements can be tricky! They [interpret white-space in the markup](https://css-tricks.com/fighting-the-space-between-inline-block-elements/) in a way that introduces extra unwanted space between each item. You can get rid of this extra space, but youâ€™ll have to implement one of several workarounds.

Fortunately, one of those workarounds is to just use flexbox! We need to use one new flexbox property called `flex-wrap` to do this. Normally, a flexbox container will try to fit all of its children onto one row. `flex-wrap` tells the container to wrap children onto subsequent rows instead.

```css
{% include_relative assets/styles/gallery.css %}
```
```html
{% include_relative assets/examples/gallery.html %}
```
